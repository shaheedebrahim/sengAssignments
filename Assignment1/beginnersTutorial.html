                <h3>Where to get started?</h3>
                <p> Competitive programming can seem extremely daunting when first getting started there
                    are dozens of algorithms, datastructures and techniques to learn. That being said if you
                    break up the task of getting started into several subtasks it can make the process
                    substantially easier. </p>

                <p> This introduction will assume no knowledge of programming languages and will start from there</p>

                <h3> Steps to Getting Started </h3>
                <p> The steps to getting started can be broken up into several high level tasks </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Learn a programming language, I recommend learning the following (in order) for the
                        reasons put in the next section:
                        <ul>
                                <li> Java </li>
                                <li> C++11 </li>
                                <li> Python </li> 
                            </ul>
                    </li> 
                    <li> Once you have learnt at least one language put your skills to use by attempting
                        an easy problem on <a href="https://open.kattis.com/"> Kattis </a> the problems are
                        organized by a difficulty level, try one that is less than 1.5. You can find more discussion
                        about online judges by visiting the <a href="onlineJudges.html">online judges page</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> Now learn about asymptotic notation you can find a tutorial here:
                        <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/asymptotic-notation/"> asymptotic notation</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> Once you have done that take a few data structures and algorithms courses, I recommend
                        algorithms 1 and algorithms 2 from Princenton University. They can be found here:
                        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1"> Algorithms 1</a> and
                        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2"> Algorithms 2</a>
                    <li> Practice! The best way to learn now is to attempt real problems. You can find
                        collections of problems with online judges all over the internet. A list of my
                        favourites with their strengths and weaknesses can be found at
                        <a href="onlineJudges.html"> here </a> </li>
                    
                </ol>
                <h3> Strengths of Each Language </h3>
                <p>
                    Java is the most recommended due to its ease of use when first getting started, it also
                    has a large library that can support a multitude of uses (BigInteger, BigDecimal etc).
                    When using Java you will be able to solve <b> <i> almost </i></b> any problem
                </p>

                <p> Next is C++11, this is recommended as the next language as there are a few problems
                    that Java will have troubles solving due to the Time Limit Exceeded error. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last is Python as it well help to solve problems that can be quickly solved using
                    the extensive Python library and also very easy problems that you can write quicker
                    in the Python
                </p>
