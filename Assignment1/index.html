    <h3>What is Competitive Programming?</h3> 
    <p>Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, 
        involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">Source</a></p> 
    <p> This explanation is complex and not entirely clear. To put it in laymens terms, competitive
        programming is a contest held for a specified amount of time where participants are challenged
        to solve specific problems within the time limit.

            <h3> What Are The Rules? </h3>
            <p> The rules to competitive programming vary by contest but since the most reknown contest is the
                ACM-ICPC (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest) 
                and most contests follow those rules we shall use them as our baselines.</p>
