            <h3>What is Competitive Programming?</h3> 
            <p>Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, 
                involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">Source</a></p> 
            <p> This explanation is complex and not entirely clear. To put it in laymens terms, competitive
                programming is a contest held for a specified amount of time where participants are challenged
                to solve specific problems within the time limit.
            </p>

                    <h3> What Are The Rules? </h3>
                    <p> The rules to competitive programming vary by contest but since the most reknown contest is the
                        ACM-ICPC (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest) 
                        and most contests follow those rules we shall use them as our baselines. The most
                    important rules are: 
                    <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/contests/acm-icpc-rules-summary.html"> source </a> </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> A team can consist of at most 3 people</li>
                        <li> Each team gets to use at most 1 computer </li>
                        <li> Use of printed books and program listings is allowed </li>
                        <li> Use of calculators, CDs, mobile phones, Internet search, etc. is prohibited </li>
                        <li> Teams may not communicate with each other during the contest </li>
                        <li> Each submission is judged during the contest as the following </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> compile-time error</li> 
                                <li> run-time error </li>
                                <li> memory-limit exceeded </li>
                                <li> incorrect output format</li>
                                <li> wrong answer </li>
                                <li> accepted</li> 
                            </ul>
                        <li> Lastly, ranking of teams is determined by number of problem solved, and in the case
                            of a tie, whomever solved the problems in the least amount of total time </li>
                    </ol>
