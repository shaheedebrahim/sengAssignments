                        <h3> Which Online Judges to Use? </h3>
                        <p>There are many online judges on the internet and I will attempt to show you the weaknesses,
                            strengths and points of interest of each. While the following comparison will not include
                            every single judge, it will cover the most used.
                        </p>
                        <p> To compare the judges several categories will be used:  </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> <b>Problem Tags:</b> A yes in this category means that the online judge
                                has tags to identify the type of problem (dynammic programming, graph, etc)
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Difficulty Levels:</b> A yes in this category means that the online
                                judge has some way of identifying the difficulty level of a problem
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Accessibility:</b> This category discusses whether the judges website
                                or platform is easily accessibile and its UI is easy to use
                            </li> 
                            <li><b>Speed</b>: This category measures the speed of the judge when
                                submitting a problem
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Contests:</b> This section asks whether the platform has contests
                                that a user can join and the format of these contests
                            </li> 
                            <li> <b>Unique Attributes:</b> The final category highlights any unique points of
                                interest that the judge has that is worth highlighting
                            </li>
                        </ol>
