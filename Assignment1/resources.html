                    <li>
                        <a href="https://cpbook.net/">Competitive Programming 3</a>, this book is the number 1
                        book that almost all top level competitive programmers own. It goes over each and every
                        single algorithm that you would ever need in a competition with code examples. Note that
                        most of the book is written in C++ with a few examples in Java.

                        <a href="https://cses.fi/book.html">Competitive Programmers Handbook</a>, this book
                        is one that was created by an international master on Codeforces named 'pllk'. It
                        is mostly geared towards the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

                        Introduction to Algorithms</a> is one of the most well known algorithms books, 
                        it covers a lot of topics past what you would need to know for competitive 
                        programming, however a solid understanding of the fundamentals in this book
                        will lead to success

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> hosts a wide variety of algorithms courses
                    that can be taken from the begginner to advanced level</li> 
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://visualgo.net/en">VisuAlgo</a> is a fantastic resource
                        for visualising what algorithms look like instead of just reading the code. If
                        you are having a hard time understanding what an algorithm actually does this is a great
                        resource

                        <a href="https://algo.is/">Algo.is</a> is a website created by Bjarki Ágúst Guðmundsson
                        developer for the online judge Kattis and word ACM-ICPC finalist. It segments Kattis 
                        problems into their specific topics so students can train on a specific algorithm type.

                        are found at <b><i>almost</i></b> every single university. These are great networks
                        as it is much easier to learn with experienced peers that by yourself
